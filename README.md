# Nerdy Soccer Scores

Around all big soccer tournaments football fans at my workplace start betting competitions (poules) predicting the scores and winners of the tournamen

I figured I would combine my lack of football knowledge and my confidence in python and statistics to build a simple script to generate plausible scores to use for joining the betting competition and actually standing a chance (and proving a point in the process :))
